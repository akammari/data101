# Create narrow queries which seem to discover something  (twice as many Hondas than GMC,  
# 5 years difference in age, more cars sold in Austin over spring than in Chicago over spring etc)


#LAW OF SMALL NUMBERS
#Small Samples are more susceptible to producing extreme results compared to large samples
