# Null Hypothesis: Initial assumption that there is no significant relationship between the variables being studied. 
# Alternative Hypothesis: Hypothesis that researchers want to test, suggesting that there is a significant relationship between the variables.
# p-value: A statistical measure to assess the strength of evidence against a null hypothesis.
# Z-test: A statistical hypothesis test used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of two groups.
